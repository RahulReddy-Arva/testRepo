# AgileTimes

Welcome to the Sample app for my Pluralsight Course  [Building Beautiful Angular Apps with PrimeNG] (https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-apps-prime-ng). and my coursework at UNC Charlotte for Systems Integration course.

I'll keep this page updated with breaking changes as the course ages.

# Building and Running
    Immediately after downloading the project use the terminal to type 'npm install' to install the node modules to your project.
    Then use 'ng build --prod' to build to build the project.
    Then type 'npm start' to run the project. This command will execute 'ng serve'. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 
    

## Take it for a spin

I deploy the latest version of the application directly to github & firebase. You can view the demo [here](https://testrepo-6f41c.firebaseapp.com/#/dashboard)
